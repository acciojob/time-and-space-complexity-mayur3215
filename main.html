	<h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in algorithm analysis. It measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute as a function of the input size. A more efficient algorithm generally has a lower time complexity. This is essential for understanding and comparing different algorithms, helping us choose the most suitable one for a given problem, especially when dealing with large datasets. As developers, optimizing time complexity contributes to building faster and more responsive applications.</p>
	<p>Space complexity is another critical aspect of algorithm analysis, focusing on the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. One common notation used to express space complexity is O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. In this notation, the space required by the algorithm grows linearly with the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> is often a concern, especially in environments with limited memory resources. It's important to strike a balance between time and space complexity, as optimizing one may come at the expense of the other.</p>
